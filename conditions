Sure! Here's an exercise based on Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for selecting records and selecting records with specific conditions:

1. **Selecting All Records**:
   ```cql
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table;
   ```

2. **Selecting Records with Specific Conditions**:
   ```cql
   -- Select records where age is greater than 25
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE age > 25;

   -- Select records where name is 'John'
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE name = 'John';

   -- Select records where age is between 20 and 30
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE age >= 20 AND age <= 30;

   -- Select records where name starts with 'J'
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE name LIKE 'J%';

   -- Select records where name contains 'oh'
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE name LIKE '%oh%';
   ```

3. **Selecting Records with Limit and Ordering**:
   ```cql
   -- Select top 10 records ordered by age in descending order
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Selecting Specific Columns**:
   ```cql
   -- Select only id and name columns
   SELECT id, name FROM my_keyspace.my_table;

   -- Select only id and name columns with specific conditions
   SELECT id, name FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE age > 25;
   ```

5. **Selecting Records with Clustering Key Filters**:
   ```cql
   -- Select records where age is greater than 25 and name is 'John' (using clustering key filter)
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE age > 25 AND name = 'John';
   ```

6. **Selecting Distinct Records**:
   ```cql
   -- Select distinct names from the table
   SELECT DISTINCT name FROM my_keyspace.my_table;
   ```

7. **Selecting Records with Token-Based Partition Key Filters**:
   ```cql
   -- Select records with a specific token range of the partition key
   SELECT * FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE token(id) > token(min_uuid) AND token(id) <= token(max_uuid);
   ```

These exercises cover various scenarios of selecting records and applying specific conditions using Cassandra Query Language (CQL). You can modify the conditions and queries to practice different scenarios as needed.

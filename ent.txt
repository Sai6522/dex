Certainly! Here's an exercise on MongoDB shell commands and user management:

1. **Connect to MongoDB**: Start by connecting to your MongoDB instance using the MongoDB shell:

   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

2. **Create a Database and Collection**: Create a new database called 'exercise' and a collection called 'users':

   ```javascript
   use exercise
   db.createCollection('users')
   ```

3. **Insert Documents**: Insert some sample user documents into the 'users' collection:

   ```javascript
   db.users.insertMany([
       { username: 'user1', email: 'user1@example.com', age: 25 },
       { username: 'user2', email: 'user2@example.com', age: 30 },
       { username: 'user3', email: 'user3@example.com', age: 35 }
   ])
   ```

4. **Query Documents**: Retrieve all documents from the 'users' collection:

   ```javascript
   db.users.find()
   ```

5. **Update Documents**: Update the age of 'user1' to 26:

   ```javascript
   db.users.updateOne({ username: 'user1' }, { $set: { age: 26 } })
   ```

6. **Delete Documents**: Delete 'user3' from the collection:

   ```javascript
   db.users.deleteOne({ username: 'user3' })
   ```

7. **User Management**:
   - **Create a User**: Create a new user with readWrite access to the 'exercise' database:

     ```javascript
     db.createUser({
         user: 'exerciseUser',
         pwd: 'password123',
         roles: ['readWrite']
     })
     ```

   - **Authenticate as New User**: Exit the MongoDB shell and authenticate as the newly created user:

     ```bash
     exit
     ```

     ```bash
     mongo -u exerciseUser -p --authenticationDatabase exercise
     ```

   - **Access Database**: After authentication, you can access the 'exercise' database and perform operations:

     ```javascript
     use exercise
     db.users.find()
     ```

   - **Drop User**: If needed, drop the created user:

     ```javascript
     db.dropUser('exerciseUser')
     ```

8. **Exit MongoDB Shell**: Finally, exit the MongoDB shell:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

This exercise covers basic MongoDB shell commands, document operations, and user management tasks. Feel free to modify and expand upon it as needed for further practice.
